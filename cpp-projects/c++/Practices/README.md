# C++ Programming Exercises

This repository contains a collection of small programs and mini projects written in C++. The code demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as input/output, control flow, string handling, file operations, data structures, and object-oriented design.

## Project Summaries

### Basic I/O and Logic

- Task 1: Output a welcome message using ‘cout’
- Task 2: Generate a 3-digit random number; compute sum, difference, product, and remainder
- Task 3:  Prompt for 3 words and 3 numbers; generate a new word using substring logic

Covered Concepts: ‘cout’, random numbers, strings, substrings, arithmetic operations

---

### String Parsing and Input Validation

- Task 1: Parse input formatted as ‘First_Last@X#Y’ and display vaccine information
- Task 2:Based on vaccine dose and age, guide user through appointment selection using `switch`

Covered Concepts: ‘string’, ‘find()’ , ‘substr()’ , ‘stoi()’ , ‘if-else’ , ‘switch’ , validation logic

---

### File Handling and Functional Programming
- Task 1: Read student records from a text file, calculate GPA, and write to a new file
- Task 2: Interactive vaccine appointment system using modular design and custom functions

Covered Concepts:  ‘fstream’ , file I/O, loops, user-defined functions, conditional branching

---

### Structure and Array Manipulation
- Task 1: Define a ‘struct’ to store meeting details (name, date, mode, capacity), and support repeated input/display with plural handling

Covered Concepts: ‘struct’ , input loops, ‘bool’ , conditional output formatting
---

##  Notes

- All programs written in standard C++
- Clear prompts, readable output, and structured code
- Each file is self-contained and includes explanatory comments
