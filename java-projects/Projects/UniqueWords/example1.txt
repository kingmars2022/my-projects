When in Rome Do as the Romans do
When in Rome do as the Romans do
Practice makes perfect
Where there is a will tHere is a way
Rome was not built in a day
Spice is the spice of life
It is always darkest before the dawn
Actions speak louder than words
You cannot book a judge under cover
If at first you do not succeed try try again
