Necessity is the mother of invention
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
You cannot book a judge under cover
Where there is a will tHere is a way
The early bird catches the worm
Two heads are the same as two heads
Waste not want Not
Pride comes before a fall
Laughter is the best medicine
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
